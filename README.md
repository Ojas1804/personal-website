# personal-website
<p> This is the front-end and back-end of my <a href="https://ojas-srivastava.xyz" target="_blank">personal website</a>. I used 
basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used a few Bootstrap classes to make my work easier.<p> 

<p>I took icons from font awsome and box-iconsa and used PHP for the back-end</p>
